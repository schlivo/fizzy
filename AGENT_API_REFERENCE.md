# Agent API & Webhook Reference

This document describes the methods and properties available to agents via the Fizzy REST API and webhooks.

## API Endpoints Available to Agents

### Boards

#### List Boards
```
GET /api/boards
```
Returns a list of all boards accessible to the authenticated user.

**Response Properties:**
- `id` - Board UUID
- `name` - Board name
- `all_access` - Boolean indicating if all users have access
- `created_at`, `updated_at` - ISO8601 timestamps
- `creator` - Object with `id` and `name`
- `columns` - Array of regular column objects, each with:
  - `id` - Column UUID
  - `name` - Column name (use this when creating cards with the `column` parameter)
  - `color` - Column color value (CSS variable format, e.g., "var(--color-card-default)")
- `virtual_columns` - Array of virtual column objects, each with:
  - `name` - Virtual column name ("NOT NOW", "MAYBE?", or "DONE")
  - `description` - Description of what the virtual column represents
  - `is_virtual` - Always `true` to indicate this is not a regular column

**Virtual Columns:**

Fizzy has three special virtual columns that represent card states rather than actual columns:
- **NOT NOW**: Postponed cards (temporarily set aside)
- **MAYBE?**: Cards awaiting triage (not yet assigned to a column)
- **DONE**: Closed cards

These can be used in the `column` parameter when creating cards or `to_column` when moving cards, just like regular column names.

#### Get Board
```
GET /api/boards/:id
```
Returns details for a specific board.

**Response Properties:** Same as List Boards

### Cards

#### List Cards
```
GET /api/cards
```

Lists and filters cards accessible to the authenticated user. This endpoint is essential for agents to recover card IDs after restart.

**Query Parameters:**
- `board_id` (optional) - Filter by board UUID
- `assignee_ids[]` (optional) - Array of user UUIDs to filter by assignees
- `creator_ids[]` (optional) - Array of user UUIDs to filter by creators
- `column` (optional) - Column name (case-insensitive) or virtual column: "NOT NOW", "MAYBE?", "DONE"
- `tags[]` (optional) - Array of tag titles to filter by
- `created_at` (optional) - Time window ("today", "yesterday", "thisweek", "thismonth", "thisyear", "lastweek", "lastmonth", "lastyear") or ISO8601 date/datetime
- `status` (optional) - Filter by status: "all" (default), "closed", "not_now"
- `sort` (optional) - Sort order: "latest" (default), "newest", "oldest"

**Response Properties:**
Array of card objects, each with:
- `id` - Card number (sequential integer)
- `title` - Card title
- `description` - Plain text description
- `status` - Status (e.g., "published")
- `column` - Column name or virtual column name ("NOT NOW", "MAYBE?", "DONE") or `null`

- `tags` - Array of tag titles
- `assignees` - Array of objects with `id` and `name`
- `created_at`, `updated_at` - ISO8601 timestamps

**Usage for Agents:**
Agents can use this endpoint to:
- Find cards they created: `GET /api/cards?creator_ids[]=AGENT_USER_UUID`
- Find cards assigned to them: `GET /api/cards?assignee_ids[]=AGENT_USER_UUID`
- Find cards with specific tags: `GET /api/cards?tags[]=agent:my-agent`
- Recover card IDs after restart by filtering on known criteria (tags, creator, assignee, etc.)
